### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

   My name is Andra and I am an e-commerce founder (BijuNet.uk) recently turned Software Developer.

   My coding journey started 27 years ago, during college, when I was introduced to computer science. My first programming language was Pascal and I remember thinking and writing my code on paper and waiting patiently to check if it was correct when the lab was open, twice a week, for one hour only (not many had computers at home back then and the college had only 30 available). 3 years later, with the college bursary savings I got my first computer and since then I have changed many throughout the years (desktops, laptops, tablets, etc) and did not pass a day without working on one. My journey took me to different places (photography, jewellery making, e-commerce, digital marketing, accounting) but I have never forgotten about algorithms, informational systems, and my love for problem-solving! 

   This year(2023), I was enrolled on the Software Development Northcoders boot camp. I took it as a challenge, went through javascript fundamentals, did the precourse, completed the given katas and passed the Entry Challenge. Little did I know back then that I would love it so much!

  I started the course on the 3rd of July and graduated on the 29th of September. It all went like a breeze! Every day we would learn new concepts through lectures and seminars, having coding sprints, pairing up with different students from the cohort, and being tested technically but also emotionally. I loved the fast-paced environment and the idea of learning something new every day so here starts my real coding journey, as a Junior Software Developer!
